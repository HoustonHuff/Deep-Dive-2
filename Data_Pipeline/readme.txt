-Android_App/: This folder contains the source code for the FileTest app along with the built application that is running on the rasberry pi.
		This application is meant to show a proof-of-concept which reads data from the Rpi's filesystem and displays this data on the applications display fragment.
		*Next Steps: Would be to pass this data over to application on the AR glasses perhaps via bluetooth; however there may be other options unexplored options.
-Bash_File/: This folder contains the bash file which is able to read data from the GPIO pins(i.e. sensors) and then save those values to a text file in the Rpi's filesystem.
